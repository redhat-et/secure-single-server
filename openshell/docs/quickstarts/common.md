# Advanced sandbox operations (experimental)

These operations support the experimental [Codex recipe](codex.md) and
administrator-reviewed custom deployments. They are not an alternate customer
quickstart. For OpenCode or OpenClaw, use only the
[OpenShell single-server guide](../../../docs/quickstarts/openshell-single-server/README.md).

On your workstation, clone this repository and transfer/checkout the same revision
on the RHEL VM. On the VM, install the prerequisites in the
[RHEL guide](../../../docs/testing/rhel-vm.md), including Podman, Python 3,
OpenSSH clients, curl and the SELinux management tools. Run from the repository root:

```bash
sudo openshell/scripts/install.sh --owner openshell-svc
```

The owner is a dedicated locked service account with lingering and a user bus.
The gateway binds loopback only, requires TLS, and maps the generated local
client certificate to the operator principal through mTLS; unauthenticated
gateway calls are rejected. The CLI imports its client bundle from
`/var/lib/openshell/tls` during first registration.
Run CLI/harness commands as that account, with its HOME and runtime bus:

```bash
harness=codex
uid=$(id -u openshell-svc)
sudo runuser -u openshell-svc -- env HOME=/var/lib/openshell-svc \
  XDG_RUNTIME_DIR=/run/user/$uid DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS=unix:path=/run/user/$uid/bus \
  "$PWD/openshell/harnesses/$harness/create.sh" --profile dev
```

For a one-off network need, create with `--policy-advisor`. This keeps the
shipped policy file unchanged and places each proposal in a manual review
queue. After the harness reports a denial and proposal, review it as the same
service owner:

```bash
openshell/scripts/policy-approve.sh list HARNESS-dev
openshell/scripts/policy-approve.sh approve HARNESS-dev --chunk-id PROPOSAL-ID
```

Type `APPROVE` at the prompt. The grant applies only to that sandbox instance
and resets when the sandbox is recreated. Successful approvals are appended to
`/var/lib/openshell/approvals.jsonl` (mode 0600); override that path for a
disposable test with `OPENSHELL_APPROVAL_AUDIT_FILE`. This local JSONL record is
an experimental audit trail, not an OCSF event stream.

The checkout and its parent directories must be readable by that account.
On bootc, use `sudo sss-bootc harness create --profile dev` instead.
Creation is detached and returns after structured Ready status; this does not
prove a subsequently launched harness task survives SSH disconnect.

Every harness sandbox is created with Podman runtime limits of two CPUs and
4 GiB of memory by default. Set `OPENSHELL_SANDBOX_CPU` (for example `1`,
`0.5`, or `500m`) and `OPENSHELL_SANDBOX_MEMORY` (for example `512Mi`, `4Gi`,
or `8G`) in the service-owner environment to change those per-sandbox limits.
These limits constrain a single sandbox; they are not an aggregate host budget
and do not reserve capacity for Praxis or other workloads.

No provider key is forwarded over SSH. Standalone credentials must be explicitly
registered with the pinned CLI's `provider create --credential KEY` environment
lookup and attached with `create.sh --provider NAME`. Use a hidden prompt in the
service-owner environment, never a literal key in shell history or an argument:

```bash
# First import an administrator-reviewed profile matching the pinned binary paths.
# The fresh gateway has no built-in provider profiles.
openshell profile lint -f /path/to/reviewed-openai-profile.yaml
openshell profile import -f /path/to/reviewed-openai-profile.yaml
read -r -s -p 'Synthetic OpenAI test key: ' OPENAI_API_KEY; printf '\n'
export OPENAI_API_KEY
openshell provider create --name test-openai --type openai --credential OPENAI_API_KEY
unset OPENAI_API_KEY
```

Initially use synthetic credentials: actual provider rewriting and real tool tasks
remain unqualified. Do not attach a direct provider in Praxis mode. Codex
rejects `--config`. See
[integration status](../../../docs/quickstarts/openshell-praxis/users.md).

Connect with the same owner environment and `connect.sh --name HARNESS-dev`.
Delete with `openshell sandbox delete HARNESS-dev` as that owner. Deleting/recreating a
sandbox does not promise workspace retention; export your work first. Do not source
helper libraries into an interactive shell. `include_workdir` grants filesystem
permissions; it does not mount your checkout or establish persistence.

The dev policy restricts GitHub API methods; Git-over-HTTPS to github.com is not
read-only. Landlock is best-effort and requires inspection of actual runtime
enforcement. See the [threat model](../threat-model.md).

Before changing OpenShell release pins, follow the [upgrade runbook](../upgrade.md).
