# Secure single-server AI harness

Secure single-server AI harness runs [OpenCode](https://github.com/anomalyco/opencode)
and [OpenClaw](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw) on one dedicated RHEL 9
x86_64 host. [OpenShell](https://github.com/NVIDIA/OpenShell/tree/v0.1.2/docs)
enforces the execution boundary. For the integrated harness paths,
[Praxis](https://github.com/praxis/praxis) routes model traffic, while
[Red Hat bootc](https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_enterprise_linux/9/html/using_image_mode_for_rhel_to_build_deploy_and_manage_operating_systems/index)
packages the reviewed deployment as a repeatable OS image.

> evidence before extending a deployment.

## How It Works

The integrated request path is:

```text
OpenCode / OpenClaw → OpenShell sandbox → Praxis → approved model
```

OpenClaw supports bounded coding tasks through Praxis; see the
[OpenClaw walkthrough](docs/quickstarts/openshell-praxis/openclaw.md) and its test evidence.

- **Dedicated always-on execution.** Long-running agents continue on the
  server while your laptop disconnects. Workspaces, audit records, and cached
  model artifacts remain on the host.
- **Policy-enforced harnesses.** OpenShell confines each harness and its tools
  with declared filesystem, network, process, runtime, and service-account
  policies. The gateway records policy decisions for later review.
- **Centralized model access.** On the integrated paths, Praxis owns provider
  credentials and selects the approved upstream. The harness and sandbox do
  not hold provider keys.
- **Repeatable deployment.** Published bootc images carry the OpenShell CLI,
  service configuration, and pinned workload references. First boot pulls the
  selected control-plane and harness images into rootless Podman storage.

## Quickstart

The published bootc image can be booted on a bootc-enabled OS or run as an OCI
container with Podman. Booting it starts the complete OpenShell deployment;
running a shell in Podman lets you inspect the image. For a working Podman-only
model call, use the [Podman quickstart](docs/quickstarts/podman/README.md).

Before starting, have:

- A disposable RHEL 9 x86_64 host and a Bash shell.
- A bootc-managed host for the bootc route, or Podman already running for the
  Podman route.
- A valid OpenAI API key and the exact ID of a model your account can access.
- The required images already cached for the under-five-minute target.

With these prerequisites, target a first model response in under five minutes.
Initial image downloads, bootc OS installation and reboot, and local-model
loading add time.

The published-image quickstart uses OpenCode. For OpenClaw, use the
[model and tool walkthrough](docs/quickstarts/openshell-praxis/openclaw.md) with
a checkout or image containing the new integration.

### Bootc-enabled operating system

Follow the [bootc quickstart](docs/quickstarts/bootc/README.md) to deploy the
published image, enter your OpenAI key, and connect to an OpenCode sandbox
configured for Praxis. It also links to local inference options.

### Podman

With Podman already running, follow the [Podman quickstart](docs/quickstarts/podman/README.md)
to inspect the bootc image or make a model call through Praxis. It includes the
required variables, credential prompt, and cleanup commands.

To install OpenShell, harnesses, and Praxis separately on a fresh VM or bare
metal, follow the [manual single-server guide](docs/quickstarts/openshell-single-server/manual.md)
and [Praxis installation walkthrough](docs/quickstarts/openshell-praxis/install.md).
