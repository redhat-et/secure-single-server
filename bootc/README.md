# RHEL 9 bootc images

bootc turns the reviewed OpenShell setup and selected harness into a repeatable
RHEL host deployment. For the curated OpenCode/OpenClaw manual and quickstart
paths, start with the
[OpenShell single-server guide](../docs/quickstarts/openshell-single-server/README.md).
Praxis is optional model routing and shared-quota tooling; its integration
remains [experimental](../docs/quickstarts/openshell-praxis/users.md).

Build one x86_64 internal base, standalone Praxis and vLLM images, and these
deployable OS images:

```text
RHEL 9 bootc → secure-single-server:base
              ├── :codex
              ├── :opencode
              └── :openclaw

RHEL 9 bootc → secure-single-server:praxis
RHEL 9 bootc → secure-single-server:vllm-cpu
RHEL 9 bootc → secure-single-server:vllm-gpu
```

The base remains the parent for harness images. It includes Podman, the native
OpenShell CLI, deployment configuration, and a boot service for OpenShell and
the optional, separately activated Praxis path. The standalone `praxis` image is
a slimmer direct RHEL
bootc image for gateway-only deployments; it excludes OpenShell, harnesses, and
NVIDIA components. The standalone `vllm-cpu` and `vllm-gpu` images are also
direct RHEL bootc images; they exclude Praxis and OpenShell. The CPU image
omits NVIDIA components, while the GPU image includes the NVIDIA 580 open
driver and Container Toolkit. Each harness image adds one harness's selection
and scripts/policies. Harness binaries run in the pinned workload containers,
not directly on the host. When Praxis is activated, this path uses its
in-memory quota profile; OpenShell is administrator-operated. It does not yet
provide Valkey, remote-gateway TLS/JWT, or ordinary-user access to OpenShell.
It is a deployment
foundation for the [phased gateway goals](../docs/roadmap.md), not completion of
the durable-quota or retained-session requirements.

## Published images

The bootc workflow publishes deployable images to `quay.io/redhat-et` with the
release-facing `v0.1` tag and a `sha-<commit>` audit tag. Registry tags are
mutable; only the resolved digest is immutable. Pin the digest, or record the
digest to which a tag resolves, when a deployment must remain exactly
reproducible. The internal `base` image is not published.

The exact OpenCode and OpenClaw `v0.1` digests used for the October 2 AWS
quickstart qualification are recorded in
[the validation report](VALIDATION.md#published-quickstart-verification-october-2).

```text
quay.io/redhat-et/secure-single-server-praxis:v0.1
quay.io/redhat-et/secure-single-server-vllm-cpu:v0.1
quay.io/redhat-et/secure-single-server-vllm-gpu:v0.1
quay.io/redhat-et/secure-single-server-codex:v0.1
quay.io/redhat-et/secure-single-server-opencode:v0.1
quay.io/redhat-et/secure-single-server-openclaw:v0.1
```

## Pull on first boot

Application containers are **not embedded** in the OS image. First boot pulls
the repository's digest-pinned Praxis and OpenShell control-plane images,
plus only the selected harness image. This keeps OS distribution smaller;
the installed host still needs disk space for the OS, container cache and
workspace data. The native OpenShell CLI is copied from its pinned image at
build time so boot never writes into `/usr`.
The Praxis image is present for the optional route; without secrets and
activation it does not provide model access, while OpenShell remains usable.

Pulls use persistent, separate rootless stores for `praxis-svc` and
`openshell-svc`. Each boot checks for the exact pinned images locally before
pulling. A cached reboot needs no registry access. A new OS deployment with
new pins needs registry access again. Failed pulls leave the boot service
failed/retrying every 30 seconds, rather than starting with different tags.
The OS remains accessible for diagnosis. No automatic image pruning runs:
retain previous digests if you want offline rollback.

Initial startup requires DNS and HTTPS access to Quay and its blob storage
endpoints. The build also requires authenticated access to `registry.redhat.io`
and RHEL package repositories. Private workload registries need authentication
in the relevant service account's Podman authfile; credentials are never baked
into the image. Bootc's own OS-update registry credentials are separate.

## Build on a RHEL AWS builder

Use a dedicated x86_64 RHEL 9 instance. The repository's
[AWS helper](../docs/testing/aws.md) can provision it: select just one
`all-in-one` instance and allow SSH from your workstation's `/32`. A 100 GiB
encrypted root disk leaves room for builds and test artifacts. Run the
following **on the Linux builder**, not in macOS's local shell:

```console
sudo dnf install -y podman skopeo
sudo podman login registry.redhat.io
sudo skopeo inspect --format '{{.Digest}}' docker://registry.redhat.io/rhel9/rhel-bootc:9.8
```

Review and record the returned digest, then build from a transferred checkout:

```console
export RHEL_BOOTC_IMAGE=registry.redhat.io/rhel9/rhel-bootc@sha256:REVIEWED_DIGEST
sudo env RHEL_BOOTC_IMAGE="$RHEL_BOOTC_IMAGE" AWS_RHUI_REGION=us-east-1 bootc/build all
sudo bootc/test-images
```

`bootc/build` requires an immutable RHEL 9 reference and refuses non-amd64
builders. It constructs a restricted build context from deployment sources;
Git history, local evidence, AWS state and workstation credentials are excluded.
Harness builds resolve the base tag to its local image ID before deriving their
images. The Praxis and vLLM images build directly from the pinned RHEL bootc
reference. Every image runs `bootc container lint` during its build.
Use a second argument such as `quay.io/YOUR_NAMESPACE/secure-single-server`
to select the output image prefix. Publishing is a separate `podman push` step.

Set `AWS_RHUI_REGION` to the builder's actual AWS region. On a PAYG RHEL host,
the helper temporarily mounts the host's RHUI repository definition, TLS
material, and AWS DNF plugin for package installation. Host networking lets
the plugin authenticate through IMDSv2 without changing the instance's metadata
hop limit; SELinux container labeling is disabled only for that build. Those
mounts are excluded from the resulting layers.
On a subscription-registered non-AWS builder, omit this variable and use
Podman's normal entitlement integration. Cloud-init is included for AWS
first-boot SSH-key provisioning.

On a clean GitHub Actions runner, set `RHSM_ORG_ID` and
`RHSM_ACTIVATION_KEY` as repository secrets. The build passes those values as
Podman build secrets, registers the ephemeral build, installs packages, and
unregisters/cleans the subscription in the same `RUN`. The values are never
written to an image layer.

## Install and boot

These are OS containers; `podman run` only tests their userspace. Use
[Red Hat's bootc image builder instructions](https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_enterprise_linux/9/html/using_image_mode_for_rhel_to_build_deploy_and_manage_operating_systems/creating-bootc-compatible-base-disk-images-with-bootc-image-builder_using-image-mode-for-rhel-to-build-deploy-and-manage-operating-systems)
to create a disk image for the selected variant. Provision an administrator
SSH key in the disk-image configuration. For EC2, follow the documented AMI
workflow and supply the required AWS boot/network configuration; the build
host's existing RHEL AMI is not itself a test of bootc.

On a booted host:

```console
ssh cloud-user@BOOTC_HOST
sudo journalctl -u secure-single-server.service -b
sudo sss-bootc openshell --version
sudo sss-bootc openshell sandbox list
```

The bootc images include cloud-init and preserve AWS's `cloud-user`
administrator login when converting a disposable RHEL host. Conversion changes
SSH host keys; verify the new fingerprint through a trusted channel. For the
dedicated vLLM install and OCI-archive switch commands, see
[the vLLM deployment guide](VLLM.md#install-or-switch-a-dedicated-aws-host).

The service creates locked, separate rootless accounts and enables lingering.
OpenShell listens on loopback ports 8090/8091 and gets only its own Podman
socket. It generates per-machine signing keys under `/var/lib/openshell`.
The OpenShell gateway container retains the existing demo's
SELinux-label-disable setting, so that container is not protected by a SELinux
container label. The host itself must keep SELinux enforcing. Rootless Podman,
loopback-only management, the locked service account, and the policy
qualification are the compensating controls. This is an administrator-trusted
demo boundary, not multi-tenant isolation.

## Optional Praxis secrets

Wait for the initial boot service to finish. It reports that Praxis awaits
secrets; OpenShell can already be inspected. Provider keys go through stdin to
the Praxis account's Podman secret store. Example in Bash, with tracing off:

```bash
set +x
read -r -s -p 'OpenAI key: ' key; printf '\n'
printf '%s' "$key" | sudo sss-bootc secret openai v1
unset key
read -r -s -p 'Anthropic key: ' key; printf '\n'
printf '%s' "$key" | sudo sss-bootc secret anthropic v1
unset key
sudo sss-bootc activate praxis-openai-api-key-v1 praxis-anthropic-api-key-v1
sudo sss-bootc status
```

Both names are required by the default two-provider Praxis configuration.
The optional `sss-bootc inference vllm` profile requires no cloud secrets. For
no-provider smoke tests use explicit dummy values; this verifies service health,
not inference. Rotation uses new secret versions and another `activate` call.
Only names are stored in `/etc/secure-single-server/secret-names`.

The boot reconciler owns its generated Quadlets and Praxis memory configuration.
Change their sources and rebuild the OS, rather than running the mutable-host
installer/upgrade/uninstall commands on this deployment. Each boot re-renders
the units from that deployment's pins, which also applies after bootc rollback.
Keys, caches, workspaces and DB contents persist; OS rollback does not roll back
application data or guarantee compatibility with older database schemas.

## Deploy standalone Praxis

The `praxis` image is independent of the OpenShell base. On its booted host,
use `sss-praxis` instead of `sss-bootc` for secrets, activation, status, and
Praxis upstream selection. It supports cloud providers or a private
`remote-vllm` endpoint; local vLLM belongs on the separate vLLM image:

```console
printf '%s' "$key" | sudo sss-praxis secret openai v1
sudo sss-praxis activate praxis-openai-api-key-v1 praxis-anthropic-api-key-v1
sudo sss-praxis inference remote-vllm 10.0.0.10:8000
sudo sss-praxis status
```

When an OS update changes OpenShell, follow the [OpenShell upgrade
runbook](../openshell/docs/upgrade.md) before staging/rebooting: export work,
delete every pre-upgrade sandbox, and recreate sandboxes with the new pins.
Apply the same recreation rule when rolling OpenShell back.

After publishing a reviewed OS image, stage it with `sudo bootc switch
REGISTRY/IMAGE:RELEASE`, inspect `sudo bootc status`, then reboot. For example:

```console
sudo bootc switch quay.io/redhat-et/secure-single-server-codex:v0.1
```

To return to the previous OS deployment, use `sudo bootc rollback` and reboot.
The selected harness is part of the OS image, so switching from Codex to
OpenCode uses the same process. Local testing can use `bootc switch --transport
containers-storage localhost/secure-single-server:opencode` after loading that
image into root's Podman store; this does not exercise registry authentication
or distribution.

## Use the selected harness

```console
sudo sss-bootc harness create --profile dev --name demo-dev
sudo sss-bootc harness connect --name demo-dev
```

These commands run the existing harness scripts as `openshell-svc`. Their
standalone policies permit provider endpoints. The
[Praxis integration workflow](../docs/quickstarts/openshell-praxis/README.md)
is separate and experimental. Codex and OpenClaw reject `--config`; OpenCode
supports the dedicated Praxis vLLM route described below. The historical cloud
integration results are separate from the Qwen qualification.
No SSH helper forwards provider keys. Standalone bindings must be explicit with
`--provider NAME`; integrated mode rejects them. Successful boot/build checks do
not prove a real model task works or that direct provider access is denied.

Start with `dev` for the CLI smoke test. OpenCode currently attempts to write
runtime state under `/sandbox/.local/share`, which the shipped read-only
`review` profile denies; sandbox creation can succeed while the CLI fails.
That profile needs a separate runtime-state policy design before it is usable
with OpenCode. Do not broaden the whole review workspace to work around it.

## Optional inference

Run [Qwen3-8B with vLLM on a separate server](VLLM.md). The single server keeps
the OpenCode → Praxis boundary and receives only a private `RFC1918_IP:PORT` upstream.
The older co-located CPU/single-L4 mode remains available for compatibility but
is deprecated for new deployments. Use the [AWS helper](../docs/testing/aws.md#separate-vllm-server)
to grant and discover the private endpoint.

## Validation

See the [dated build and AWS boot results](VALIDATION.md) for tested image IDs,
checks and remaining qualification.

```console
python3 bootc/tests/build.py
shellcheck -x bootc/build bootc/test-images bootc/test-host bootc/scripts/*
sudo bootc/test-images
# On the booted host, after provisioning dummy or real secrets:
sudo bootc/test-host codex
# Record sandbox kernel qualification (Landlock LSM and seccomp listener mode):
sudo bootc/test-kernel READY_SANDBOX_NAME
```

The Python tests exercise build validation, parent-image selection and context
isolation. Container checks verify OS, CLI compatibility, service enablement,
absence of machine keys/secrets, and exactly one harness per child.
Host checks verify bootc, read-only `/usr`, SELinux, service health, rootless
account permissions, cached harness selection and loopback-only listeners.

Full acceptance also requires booting a disk/AMI with SELinux enforcing,
checking first-boot pulls and retry after registry failure, activating Praxis
with dummy secrets, rebooting with cached images, and exercising an OS update
and rollback. Real-provider harness and network-policy acceptance remain
separate. Record the OS and workload digests with each result.
