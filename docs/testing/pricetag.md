# Remote gateway with PriceTag spending budgets

This pilot adds a JWT-authenticated HTTPS gateway, PriceTag user/admin dashboards
and PostgreSQL beside an existing all-in-one installation. It reuses that
installation's providers and model aliases. The original gateway and vLLM stay
available while the new endpoint is qualified. The metered endpoint uses USD
budgets and retains PriceTag’s legacy 10-billion-token monthly safety net.
It has no Praxis `token_rate_limit` filter.

```

The `manual_jwt` filter runs inside Praxis; there is no extra authentication
service and no metering source change. Inference and login use the same public
key and live credential registry. Caller JWTs have **no automatic expiry**.
Their signature, issuer, audience, subject, issue time and registry membership
are verified. If a credential includes `exp` or `nbf`, those claims are enforced.

The callback listens on private container port 18084. Publish only HTTPS 8443;
never publish 18084 or the metering/database ports. The public gateway rejects
`/validate`. Metering calls `MAAS_VALIDATE_URL=http://pricetag-gateway:18084/validate`
and creates its existing seven-day Secure/HttpOnly/SameSite browser cookie.
Other inference, accounting and dashboard-boundary listeners use container
loopback. The dashboard boundary strips caller-supplied identity headers and
requires an allowed Origin on writes and login.

## Build the images and test locally

A public metering image has not been verified. The upstream manifest names
`ghcr.io/redhat-et/pricetag-metering:latest`, but its image provenance document
identifies the deployed artifact as internal to OpenShift. Build the pinned,
unmodified upstream source with this repository's packaging helper:

```console
git clone https://github.com/redhat-et/pricetag-metering.git ../pricetag-metering
python3 scripts/pricetag/build-metering --source ../pricetag-metering
```

The helper builds source commit `557ceb1cbe1316d93e0f682baa8301455956fe18` from
`git archive`, so local checkout edits and secrets do not enter the build. Its
Containerfile pins builder/runtime digests and targets the build host architecture.
Use `--platform linux/amd64` for an image to transfer to an x86 RHEL host; building
natively on RHEL is faster than emulation. Local ARM and RHEL AMD64 builds have
different image IDs even when they use the same source.

Build the experimental worktree containing `manual_jwt`:

```console
podman build --build-arg FEATURES=otel -t localhost/praxis-experimental:manual-jwt \
  -f ../experimental/Containerfile ../experimental
python3 scripts/pricetag/local up
python3 -B tests/pricetag/local.py
```

Replace `../experimental` with the reviewed filter worktree path. After release,
use the published image digest only after confirming it includes `manual_jwt`.
The experimental repository publishes to GHCR; the Quay image also depends on
its downstream build completing. Set `PRAXIS_IMAGE` and `METERING_IMAGE` before
initialization to select other reviewed image references.

Open **https://localhost:8443/login**. The local deployment publishes only Mac
loopback. It uses a synthetic provider and deliberately inflated test prices;
no cloud credentials are needed. Trust `.state/pricetag/tls/ca.pem` for this
local test in your browser, or use the browser's certificate exception for
localhost. Do not disable certificate verification in a real harness setup.

Paste `.state/pricetag/alice.jwt` for the user dashboard, or
`.state/pricetag/admin.jwt` for the admin dashboard. Tokens are private files;
copy their contents locally, not into chat or a GitHub issue. `/dashboard`
shows usage; `/admin#quotas` opens spending policy and per-person overrides.
The acceptance test creates separate test users and exercises native Chat,
Responses and Messages with JSON and SSE, forged identities, USD denial,
independent users and a live allowance increase.

```console
python3 scripts/pricetag/local status
python3 scripts/pricetag/local down
```

`down` retains the database and credentials. `up` resumes them without resetting
budgets and restarts the gateway to load its rendered configuration. Both application
image IDs are recorded at initialization in
`.state/pricetag/deployment.json`; rebuilding a tag alone does not upgrade
running services. Image upgrades require reviewing the IDs and recreating the
application containers with their existing state and database volume.

You can also preview client configuration against this local gateway:

The OpenCode helper explicitly enables the `praxis` provider in its per-process
configuration, so a pre-existing provider allowlist cannot hide this gateway's
models. It does not edit the user's persistent OpenCode configuration.
[OpenCode provider configuration](https://opencode.ai/docs/config/#enabled-providers).

```console
python3 scripts/pricetag/harness opencode --url https://localhost:8443 \
  --token-file .state/pricetag/alice.jwt --ca-file .state/pricetag/tls/ca.pem \
  --model demo-model --print-config
```

The synthetic provider is for protocol and spending tests. Use the real vLLM
on RHEL for interactive coding tasks.

## Prepare the existing RHEL VM

First follow [AWS HTTPS access](aws.md#pricetag-on-an-existing-vm). Only your
workstation's public IPv4 `/32` needs TCP 8443 access. On-host tests use HTTPS
loopback with a caller JWT and do not need the VM's public IP in the allowlist.

Use an existing all-in-one provider configuration with a unified model catalog.
The first pilot needs `/etc/praxis/shared-gateway.yaml` in the installer's JSON
format and `/etc/praxis/unified-models.json`. It needs the locked `praxis-svc`
account, its `praxis.network` Quadlet and its existing provider secret references.
On a fresh VM, complete the [provider setup](../quickstarts/common/providers.md)
and unified catalog first. A separate external vLLM can replace the local model
later without moving the metering database.

From the secure-single-server checkout, copy only the deployment sources:

```console
tar --no-xattrs -czf - scripts/pricetag scripts/common/lib.sh scripts/common/harness.py \
  scripts/common/unified_config.py scripts/remote-gateway/credentials configs/pricetag | \
  ssh -o IdentitiesOnly=yes -o ForwardAgent=no -i "$SSH_KEY" "$RHEL_HOST" \
    'mkdir -p ~/secure-single-server-pricetag && tar -xzf - -C ~/secure-single-server-pricetag'
```

On RHEL, obtain the same pinned metering source and the reviewed experimental
filter branch. Build both images natively in the SSH administrator's Podman
storage, then load them into the locked service account's storage:

```console
cd ~/secure-single-server-pricetag
git clone https://github.com/redhat-et/pricetag-metering.git ~/pricetag-metering
python3 scripts/pricetag/build-metering --source ~/pricetag-metering
podman build --build-arg FEATURES=otel -t localhost/praxis-experimental:manual-jwt \
  -f ~/experimental/Containerfile ~/experimental
PRICETAG_UID=$(id -u praxis-svc)
svc() {
  (cd /tmp && sudo -u praxis-svc env \
    XDG_RUNTIME_DIR="/run/user/$PRICETAG_UID" \
    DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS="unix:path=/run/user/$PRICETAG_UID/bus" "$@")
}
set -o pipefail
podman save localhost/pricetag-metering:upstream-557ceb1 | svc podman load
podman save localhost/praxis-experimental:manual-jwt | svc podman load
METERING_IMAGE=$(svc podman image inspect localhost/pricetag-metering:upstream-557ceb1 --format '{{.Id}}')
PRAXIS_IMAGE=$(svc podman image inspect localhost/praxis-experimental:manual-jwt --format '{{.Id}}')
METERING_IMAGE="sha256:${METERING_IMAGE#sha256:}"
PRAXIS_IMAGE="sha256:${PRAXIS_IMAGE#sha256:}"
```

`~/experimental` must contain the reviewed filter implementation. Alternatively,
transfer an already built **linux/amd64** image with `podman save`, then load it
on RHEL; no registry publication is required. Do not transfer the Mac's ARM image.

Review the initial pricing sources. Every gateway alias receives a separate
snapshot of its source model's rates; a missing source price stops bootstrap
before the HTTPS gateway starts. For the local quantized Qwen pilot, this example
uses PriceTag's existing 27B reference rates as an internal chargeback rate.
That rate is not an AWS infrastructure cost or a provider invoice. All other
aliases default to their configured upstream model's PriceTag catalog entry.

```console
cat > ~/pricetag-price-sources.json <<'JSON'
{"vllm/qwen3.8-27b-int4": "Qwen3.8-27B-FP8"}
JSON
GATEWAY_HOST='YOUR_VM_PUBLIC_IP_OR_DNS_NAME'
cd ~/secure-single-server-pricetag
sudo python3 scripts/pricetag/prepare.py \
  --hostname "$GATEWAY_HOST" \
  --metering-image "$METERING_IMAGE" --praxis-image "$PRAXIS_IMAGE" \
  --provider-unit "/etc/containers/systemd/users/$PRICETAG_UID/praxis.container" \
  --price-sources "$HOME/pricetag-price-sources.json" \
  --monthly-usd 5
```

Preparation writes configuration and separate Quadlets in `/etc/praxis-pricetag`.
Add `--vllm-only` to exclude cloud models, routes and provider secret mounts
without deleting credentials from the original installation. Only secrets
needed by the rendered gateway are mounted. Use
[the fresh cloud-only guide](aws-pricetag.md) and `--mock-provider` for a
separate performance VM without an existing provider installation.
It creates the issuer, a private test CA, and initial `admin`, `alice` and `bob`
JWTs under `/root/pricetag-admin`, without an `exp` claim. Their active digests
live in `/etc/praxis-pricetag/gateway/users.json`. It refuses existing
directories so it cannot silently rotate keys or replace a deployment.
The public key and server TLS key go to containers; the JWT signing key and CA
signing key stay with the administrator. Review the generated
`quadlets/`, `models.json`, `price-sources.json` and `bootstrap.sql` before starting.
Environment files contain secrets and must remain private.

```console
sudo scripts/pricetag/start
svc systemctl --user status pricetag-db pricetag-metering pricetag-gateway --no-pager
```

Startup applies SELinux labels, starts PostgreSQL and metering, waits for
readiness, and initializes the fresh database before starting the gateway. Login becomes
available when the gateway’s private callback is listening. It
creates the unique event-ID index, enables monthly USD enforcement without
post-cap exceptions, and snapshots alias prices. Subsequent starts preserve
the existing policy. It refuses to bootstrap a database that already has usage.
Existing databases require PriceTag's separate event-idempotency migration.

## Test JWT access on the VM and from your laptop

On RHEL, use HTTPS loopback with the CA and an ordinary user's JWT. The test
certificate includes localhost and the configured public host. As the SSH
administrator, export only a user token and the public CA certificate into
your own private client directory:

```console
install -d -m 0700 "$HOME/.config/praxis-pricetag"
sudo install -m 0600 -o "$(id -u)" -g "$(id -g)" \
  /root/pricetag-admin/alice.jwt "$HOME/.config/praxis-pricetag/caller.jwt"
sudo install -m 0600 -o "$(id -u)" -g "$(id -g)" \
  /etc/praxis-pricetag/ca.pem "$HOME/.config/praxis-pricetag/ca.pem"
cd ~/secure-single-server-pricetag
python3 scripts/pricetag/harness opencode --url https://localhost:8443 \
  --token-file "$HOME/.config/praxis-pricetag/caller.jwt" \
  --ca-file "$HOME/.config/praxis-pricetag/ca.pem" --model vllm/qwen3.8-27b-int4
```

The harness must already be installed for the SSH account. Use an ordinary
user for budget tests: super-admins are exempt from spending limits. The
launcher first fetches `/v1/models` using that JWT; loopback has the same
authentication requirement as the public endpoint. Add `--print-config` to
inspect a redacted configuration without launching the harness.

On your laptop, copy those two exported client files through SSH, then run the
launcher from this checkout with the public hostname:

```console
install -d -m 0700 "$HOME/.config/praxis-pricetag"
scp -o IdentitiesOnly=yes -o ForwardAgent=no -i "$SSH_KEY" \
  "$RHEL_HOST:.config/praxis-pricetag/caller.jwt" \
  "$RHEL_HOST:.config/praxis-pricetag/ca.pem" "$HOME/.config/praxis-pricetag/"
chmod 0600 "$HOME/.config/praxis-pricetag/caller.jwt"
python3 scripts/pricetag/harness opencode \
  --url https://YOUR_VM_PUBLIC_IP_OR_DNS_NAME:8443 \
  --token-file "$HOME/.config/praxis-pricetag/caller.jwt" \
  --ca-file "$HOME/.config/praxis-pricetag/ca.pem" --model vllm/qwen3.8-27b-int4
```

Never copy issuer or service private keys to clients. Trust the CA in your
browser and paste the same caller JWT at
`https://YOUR_VM_PUBLIC_IP_OR_DNS_NAME:8443/login`. That origin must match the
public host configured during preparation. For admin access, export and
transfer `admin.jwt` separately with the same private-file procedure; use it
only for administration.

<details>
<summary>What the harness launcher configures, and file-based alternatives</summary>

This deployment's launcher is `scripts/pricetag/harness`. It reads the
authenticated gateway catalog and uses the selected alias's native API,
context window and output allowance. Pass the HTTPS origin without `/v1`.
The model argument is the complete gateway alias, such as
`vllm/qwen3.8-27b-int4` or `openai/gpt-5.4-mini`.

| Harness argument | Configuration supplied at launch | Persistent alternative |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `opencode` | `OPENCODE_CONFIG_CONTENT`: provider `praxis`, base URL ending `/v1`, caller JWT, selected model and limits. Chooses OpenAI-compatible or Anthropic SDK from the catalog; `--api anthropic` selects Messages on a dual-API model | Put the provider/model block in `opencode.json` and load the JWT from a private environment variable |
| `codex` | Command-line provider settings using `/v1/responses`, caller JWT environment variable and context/compaction limits. Local vLLM gets a generated model catalog under `~/.cache/pricetag-harness` | Put the equivalent provider/model settings in `~/.codex/config.toml`, keeping credentials in the environment |
| `claude-code` | `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL`, `ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN`, explicit model/context/output settings; local Qwen gets the existing custom-menu settings and compatible reasoning effort | Export the same environment settings before launching `claude`; keep the token in a private file |

Use `--print-config` for the exact settings; token values are redacted.
The helper changes its child process environment and writes only the Codex
model catalog, leaving existing harness settings files intact. The CA is
supplied through each client's TLS environment settings. Local Qwen thinking
remains enabled by the vLLM configuration; this helper does not turn it off.

This is catalog-driven launch configuration. Native model discovery inside
Claude's `/model` menu remains disabled for this pilot; it is not established
by successfully fetching `/v1/models`. Codex needs a Responses-capable model,
Claude needs a Messages-capable model, and OpenCode can use either. The helper
rejects combinations that require API translation the gateway does not provide.

## Administrator scripts: provision, rotate and revoke

After SSH, link the prepared Alice subject to a person, set a monthly USD
allowance, and replace its initial credential:

```console
sudo python3 scripts/pricetag/user --subject alice --name 'Alice' --rotate \
  --monthly-usd 5 --output /root/pricetag-admin/alice-new.jwt
```

For a new user, choose an unused subject/output path and omit `--rotate`.
The helper logs into the dashboard over verified HTTPS loopback using the admin
JWT, uses the returned session for its admin API calls, and issues the caller
credential into a new private file. It never prints token values. The person
mapping is deterministic and existing mappings are retained.

Rotate an existing credential without changing any spending configuration:

```console
sudo python3 scripts/pricetag/credentials rotate --subject alice \
  --output /root/pricetag-admin/alice-rotated.jwt
```

The old token stops working for subsequent inference requests and new logins;
the new token retains the exact same `sub`, person, allowance and usage history.
Rotation has no overlap period. Distribute the replacement privately and restart
the user's harness with its updated token file. In-flight requests may complete.
Admin tokens use the same command with `--subject admin`; update the private
admin-token file used by `scripts/pricetag/user` afterward.

Revoke or inspect credentials without contacting metering:

```console
sudo python3 scripts/pricetag/credentials revoke --subject alice
sudo python3 scripts/pricetag/credentials list
```

Use `rotate` to restore a revoked subject with a new token. `issue` refuses an
existing subject; `rotate` and `revoke` refuse unknown subjects. Output files are
created with mode 0600 and never overwritten. Registry updates are locked and
atomically replaced, retaining their owner and permissions. Mount the entire
gateway directory, so replacements are visible inside the container. A missing
or corrupt registry fails closed with 503; revoked/unknown tokens return 401.
Keep its parent directory writable only by the administrator. On macOS Podman,
the shared filesystem can briefly report a missing file after atomic replacement;
the gateway returns 503 until the updated registry is visible. RHEL uses a
server-local file.

**Browser-session boundary:** PriceTag validates the JWT only at login. Existing
browser cookies remain valid for seven days despite token revocation/rotation.
They do not contain a token identifier, so individual immediate browser-session
revocation is unavailable with unmodified metering. An administrator can rotate
`SESSION_SECRET` and restart metering to invalidate **all** dashboard sessions;
this preserves inference tokens and spending. Browser logout only clears that
browser's cookie. A compromised account may require both token revocation and
global session invalidation. JWTs themselves remain valid indefinitely until
manual revocation, rotation or issuer-key replacement.

For local Podman administration, override paths:

```console
python3 scripts/pricetag/credentials rotate --subject alice \
  --registry .state/pricetag/gateway/users.json --key .state/pricetag/issuer/private.pem \
  --output .state/pricetag/alice-rotated.jwt
```

## Boundaries and operation

- USD allowances are the primary budget. `MONTHLY_TOKEN_QUOTA=10000000000`
  retains the upstream monthly token safety net, so exhausting either limit
  can deny a request. Token counts also remain necessary for pricing.
- USD enforcement uses recorded spending and PriceTag's current decision cache
  (up to 15 seconds). In-flight requests can overshoot a limit. It is not a
  prepaid reservation mechanism. Admin override changes invalidate that cache.
- Metering unavailability rejects new requests with 503. Usage delivery after a
  response is asynchronous; delivery failure can undercount and needs monitoring.
- The pinned Praxis filter's 429 text still says `token budget exhausted`.
  The decision combines USD spending with the retained legacy safety net. The dashboard shows
  the USD allowance; correcting the filter's denial wording is still required.
- Model aliases have separate initial rate snapshots. Avoid changing those rows
  during the pilot: the current quota query reprices historical usage. Review
  pricing changes and historical-ledger behavior before production use.
- Kubernetes routing, MaaS key management and impersonation are outside this
  standalone pilot. Their routes are not exposed through the gateway.
- Back up with `svc podman exec pricetag-db pg_dump -U metering -d metering -Fc`
  into an administrator-only file. Keep encrypted backups of the issuer, TLS,
  session/M2M configuration and database together. Rehearse restoration to a
  separate database before relying on recovery.

To roll back the pilot, stop `pricetag-gateway`, `pricetag-metering` and
`pricetag-db` user services. Keep the named volume and configuration for recovery.
The original all-in-one services and model weights remain available. Remove the
8443 security-group rule and matching journal entry if abandoning remote access.
Do not run the original shared-gateway quota helper against this USD policy.

For broader client access later, follow
[the public HTTPS transition](aws-pricetag.md#open-the-real-server-to-any-ip-later).
Retain JWT/TLS, private accounting/database ports and restricted SSH. The admin
dashboard shares port 8443 with inference: opening that port also makes its login
and routes publicly reachable, with authentication and role checks still enforced.
If admin access must remain IP-restricted, first add a separate application or
listener boundary. The AWS guide includes the access tradeoff and rollback steps.
