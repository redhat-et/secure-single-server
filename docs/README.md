# Documentation map

Start with the [repository overview](../README.md), then follow the route that
matches your decision. You do not need to read every document in this
repository; the guides below are separated by the question they answer.

## Recommended route

1. **Understand the architecture.** Read
   [why this architecture exists](quickstarts/architecture-walkthrough/README.md)
   before choosing a deployment. It explains what each layer protects, what it
   does not protect, and which evidence is accepted.
2. **Deploy a sandboxed harness.** Use
   [OpenShell](https://github.com/NVIDIA/OpenShell/tree/v0.1.3/docs) through the
   [manual container guide](quickstarts/openshell-single-server/manual.md) or
   [bootc deployment guide](quickstarts/openshell-single-server/bootc.md) to deploy [OpenCode](https://github.com/anomalyco/opencode) or
   [OpenClaw](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw) on one trusted RHEL host.
3. **Add model routing.** Use
   [Praxis](https://github.com/praxis/praxis) through the
   [OpenShell + Praxis guide](quickstarts/openshell-praxis/README.md) when the
   sandboxed harness should use a gateway instead of holding provider
   credentials.
4. **Choose the inference path.** Follow the
   [private vLLM workflow](quickstarts/common/vllm.md) or
   [provider setup](quickstarts/common/providers.md) after selecting the
   gateway route.
5. **Reproduce the evidence.** Use the [testing guide](testing/README.md) and
   [compatibility matrix](testing/compatibility.md) before treating a
   combination as qualified.
6. **Plan the next capability.** Use the [roadmap](roadmap.md) to separate
   accepted behavior from work still in progress.

## Choose by outcome

| If you need to… | Use |
| --- | --- |
| Explain or review the complete system | [Architecture walkthrough](quickstarts/architecture-walkthrough/README.md) |
| Install OpenShell and harness containers separately | [Manual single-server deployment](quickstarts/openshell-single-server/manual.md) |
| Deploy or evaluate OpenShell quickly | [Single-server bootc quickstart](quickstarts/bootc/README.md) |
| Inspect the bootc image or make a model call with Podman | [Podman quickstart](quickstarts/podman/README.md) |
| Combine OpenShell with Praxis | [OpenShell + Praxis guide](quickstarts/openshell-praxis/README.md) |
| Serve users from accounts on one RHEL host | [All-in-one gateway](quickstarts/all-in-one/README.md) |
| Connect harnesses on remote client machines | [Remote HTTPS/JWT gateway](quickstarts/remote-gateway/README.md) |
| Deploy the OS image | [bootc guide](../bootc/README.md) |
| Configure harnesses, providers, or quotas | [Common configuration index](quickstarts/common/README.md) |
| Inspect OpenShell policies and boundaries | [OpenShell documentation](../openshell/docs/README.md) |
| Reproduce validation or add a new combination | [Testing guide](testing/README.md) |
| Understand future scope and acceptance | [Roadmap](roadmap.md) |

## Reading rules

- The recommended route is the sandboxed **harness → OpenShell → Praxis →
  inference** path. Other guides describe alternate deployment shapes, not
  interchangeable substitutes.
- Quickstarts tell you how to run a documented path. Validation records and
  the compatibility matrix determine what is qualified.
- Trust-model and quota documents define boundaries that are easy to miss when
  reading configuration alone.

This repository tracks only its pinned deployment contracts and acceptance
evidence. Consult upstream documentation for general project features that
this deployment does not qualify.

## Next step

Start with the [architecture walkthrough](quickstarts/architecture-walkthrough/README.md).
If you already understand the system and only need a disposable evaluation,
use the [bootc quickstart](quickstarts/bootc/README.md).
